;;;; Warranted command trees & their representation in files
;;;
;;; A warranted command tree (WCT) is a list of nodes.
;;; A node is either the empty list, or it is a cons of a name and a WCT.
;;; A node's name (key) is either a string, the symbol * or the symbol **.
;;; * matches one component, ** matches zero or more components.
;;;
;;; A list of strings (from a command line), known as an slist in this code
;;;  is matched against a WCT.
;;; If the list is null then it matches the empty WCT, a WCT with an empty
;;;  child node, or a WCT with a child node whose name is ** and whose WCT is
;;;  null (the last case makes sure that this is really the end of the WCT).
;;; If the list is not null it matches if its first element matches and the
;;;  remaining elements match the WCT which is the child of the matched node.
;;; An element matches a node if the node's name is *, if the node's name is a
;;;  string which is equal to the element, or if the node's name is ** and
;;;  the rest of the slist matches either a WCT whose only node is the node
;;;  that matched, or if it matches the WCT of the node.
;;;
;;; WCTs are read from files in two forms: as WCTs or as command specifications
;;;  which are turned into WCTs.
;;; A command specification is just a list containing a command and its
;;;  arguments, where any entry can also be * or **.
;;; Each file has a single form which can contain as many specifications or WCTs
;;;  as you like.  There's no fancy merging of the tops of trees.
;;;
;;; The default set of config files is "/etc/warranted.rktd",
;;;  "/usr/local/etc/warranted.rktd" and "~/etc/warranted.rktd": all of these
;;;  are checked and if they exist read into a single WCT.
;;;
;;; Commands, but not their arguments, are matched against the absolute path of
;;;  the executable: so 'cat foo' would turn into '/bin/cat foo' for instance.
;;;
